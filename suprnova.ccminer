  Welcome to Suprnova's BCH (Bitcoin Cash) Pool. This is NOT the original
Bitcoin, it's "Bitcoin Cash" which resulted from a fork on 01. August 2017. It
shares the same mining algo but it's a different coin.

As this is a separate project - please register a new account, even if you've
registered on a different Suprnova Pool before.

stratum+tcp://bcc.suprnova.cc:3333 Nicehash Port: 3334
Getting Started Guide

1. Create account.

  • Register here, or login if you already have account
  • Create a worker that will be used by the miner to login

2. Download a miner.

  • Intel/ATI/AMD CGMiner Windows: Download here
  • Intel/ATI/AMD CGMiner Linux: Download Here
  • Intel/ATI/AMD BFGMiner Linux/Windows: Download here
  • Fabulous Panda Miner Mac OS X: Download here
  • Minerd CPU Miner Mac/Linux/Windows: Download here.

3. Configure your miner.

    If your using Linux, Then type the following into the console:

  • CGMiner

    ./cgminer -o stratum+tcp://bcc.suprnova.cc:3333 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

  • BFGMiner

    ./bfgminer -o stratum+tcp://bcc.suprnova.cc:3333 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword


    If you want to mine on a Windows Operating System, then you'll need to
    create a batch file to start your miner.

    Simply open notepad and then copy and paste the following:

  • CGMiner

    cgminer -o stratum+tcp://bcc.suprnova.cc:3333 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

  • BFGMiner

    bfgminer -o stratum+tcp://bcc.suprnova.cc:3333 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

  • MinerD

    minerd -a -t 6 -s 4 -o stratum+tcp://bcc.suprnova.cc:3333 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword


    You then need to change "-u Weblogin.Worker -p Worker password" to reflect
    your own account. Eg, "-u Steve.StevesWorker -p StevesWorkerPassword" then
    go to "File > Save as" and save the file as "RunMe.bat" in the same folder
    containing your miners application files. You are now ready to mine, double
    click on "RunMe.bat" to start mining. If you want, you can create
    additional workers with usernames and passwords of your choice here

4. Create a Bitcoin Cash address to receive payments.

  • Downloading the client & block chain: Download the Bitcoin Cash client from
    here.

    Generate a new address and input it on your account page to receive
    payments.

3. Configure your miner.

    Settings for Stratum (recommended):

    STRATUM:         stratum+tcp://zcl.suprnova.cc
    PORT:            4042
    Username:        Weblogin.Worker
    Password:        Worker Password

  • CPU Miner
  • Nicehash CPU + GPU Miner

    ./nheqminer -l zcl.suprnova.cc:4042 -u Weblogin.Worker -p password  


  • Genoils AMD GPU Miner

    genoil.exe -c zcl.suprnova.cc:4042 -u Weblogin.Worker -p Worker password -P 0 -g 0 1 -i 13

    ZecMiner64.exe -zpool  zcl.suprnova.cc:4042 -zwal YourUsername.YourWorker -zpsw YourWorkerPass -allpools 1



    Note: Static Diff can always be set through the password field. If you want
    a worker diff of 8 use d=8 as your password like so:

    nheqminer.exe -u suprnova.4 -p d=8 



    If you prefer anonymous mining without registering on the pool, you can
    also just specify your wallet address for mining::

    ./nheqminer -l zcl.suprnova.cc:4042 -u t1gmg4yJuwDvErGbzVERx69zt9qsa4ZpMYG -p x


    Anonymous Statistics for your miner can then be read by appending/replacing
    your wallet address to/in this URL:
    https://zcl.suprnova.cc/index.php?page=anondashboard&user=
    t1gmg4yJuwDvErGbzVERx69zt9qsa4ZpMYG



    You then need to change "-u Weblogin.Worker -p Worker password" to reflect
    your own account. Eg, "-u Steve.StevesWorker -p StevesWorkerPassword" Then
    go to "File => Save as" and save the file as "RunMe.bat" in the same folder
    as minerd. You are now ready to mine, double click on "RunMe.bat" to start
    mining. If you want, you can create additional workers with usernames and
    passwords of your choice here

3. Configure your miner.

    Settings for Stratum (recommended):

    STRATUM:         stratum+tcp://zen.suprnova.cc
    PORT:            3618
    Username:        Weblogin.Worker
    Password:        Worker Password

  • CPU Miner

    ./zcash-standalone-miner/src/zcash-miner -stratum=stratum+tcp://zen.suprnova.cc:3618 -user=Weblogin.Worker -password=Worker password -debug -printtoconsole



  • Nicehash CPU + GPU Miner

    ./nheqminer -l zen.suprnova.cc:3618 -u Weblogin.Worker -p password -t 4 


  • NOTE: On the latest Windows Binary you don't need "-l zen.suprnova.cc:3618"
    at all - don't use that flag, it will be re-added later ! So use the miner
    like this:

    ./nheqminer -l zen.suprnova.cc:3618 -u Weblogin.Worker -p password -t 4 


  • Genoils AMD GPU Miner

    genoil.exe -c zen.suprnova.cc:3618 -u Weblogin.Worker -p Worker password -P 0 -g 0 1 -i 13 



  • Claymore Dual Miner

    ZecMiner64.exe -zpool  zen.suprnova.cc:3618 -zwal YourUsername.YourWorker -zpsw YourWorkerPass -allpools 1


  • EWBF's CUDA Zcash miner

    miner.exe --server zen.suprnova.cc --user suprnova.1 --pass x --port 3618  --cuda_devices 0 1 2 3 


  • tpruvots ccminer CUDA

    ccminer.exe -a equihash -o stratum+tcp://zen.suprnova.cc:3620 -u suprnova.1 -p x 


    Note: Static Diff can always be set through the password field. If you want
    a worker diff of 8 use d=8 as your password like so:

    nheqminer.exe -u suprnova.4 -p d=8 



    You then need to change "-u Weblogin.Worker -p Worker password" to reflect
    your own account. Eg, "-u Steve.StevesWorker -p StevesWorkerPassword" Then
    go to "File => Save as" and save the file as "RunMe.bat" in the same folder
    as minerd. You are now ready to mine, double click on "RunMe.bat" to start
    mining. If you want, you can create additional workers with usernames and
    passwords of your choice here

4. Create a ZENcoin address to receive payments.

  • Downloading the client & block chain: Download the ZENcoin client from here
    .

    Generate a new address and input it on your account page to receive
    payments.

  Suprnova's ZEC (ZCash) Pool // Algo: Equihash // All services okay

[Eur]    EU & US Mining Node: stratum+tcp://zec-eu.suprnova.cc:2142 (Backup:
stratum+tcp://zec.suprnova.cc:2142 )
[usa]    US Mining Node: stratum+tcp://zec-us.suprnova.cc:2142
[Chi]     China/Shenzhen ! stratum+tcp://zec-cn.suprnova.cc:2142
[Aus]     Asia Pacific Mining Node: stratum+tcp://zec-apac.suprnova.cc:2142

Check this great Nicehash Mining-Tutorial from BTC-Kyle Thanks a lot !

Please use www.whattomine.com for calculating your mining estimates per hour/
day/week until it's fixed on the Statistics page.
You currently earn more per day than what it estimated on the pool

Anonymous mining possible too !

For Nicehash use zec-eu.suprnova.cc:2143 It is not recommended to use nicehash
on this pool !!!

You can define your own diff through password field, for example: d=8192 as
password gives you 8192 as diff

SSL Port for Claymore 9 added: ssl://zec.suprnova.cc:2242

Special Port for CCMiner added: stratum+tcp://zec.suprnova.cc:4142

  stratum+tcp://emc2.suprnova.cc:3366 ASIC-Port: 3365 / Nicehash Port: 3367
Getting Started Guide

1. Create account.

  • Register here, or login if you already have account
  • Create a worker that will be used by the miner to login

2. Download a miner.

  • Intel/ATI/AMD CGMiner (3.7.2) Windows: Download here
  • Intel/ATI/AMD CGMiner (3.7.2) Linux: Download Here
  • NVIDIA Cudaminer: Download here
  • Intel/ATI/AMD BFGMiner Linux/Windows: Download here
  • Fabulous Panda Miner Mac OS X: Download here
  • Minerd CPU Miner Mac/Linux/Windows: Download here.

3. Configure your miner.

    If your using Linux, Then type the following into the console:

  • CGMiner

    ./cgminer --scrypt -o stratum+tcp://emc2.suprnova.cc:3366 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

  • BFGMiner

    ./bfgminer --scrypt -o stratum+tcp://emc2.suprnova.cc:3366 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword


    If you want to mine on a Windows Operating System, then you'll need to
    create a batch file to start your miner.

    Simply open notepad and then copy and paste the following:

  • CGMiner

    cgminer --scrypt -o stratum+tcp://emc2.suprnova.cc:3366 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

  • BFGMiner

    bfgminer --scrypt -o stratum+tcp://emc2.suprnova.cc:3366 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

  • MinerD

    minerd -a --scrypt -t 6 -s 4 -o stratum+tcp://emc2.suprnova.cc:3366 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

  • Cudaminer For NVIDIA Cards

    cudaminer -o stratum+tcp://emc2.suprnova.cc:3366 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword


    You then need to change "-u Weblogin.Worker -p Worker password" to reflect
    your own account. Eg, "-u Steve.StevesWorker -p StevesWorkerPassword" then
    go to "File > Save as" and save the file as "RunMe.bat" in the same folder
    containing your miners application files. You are now ready to mine, double
    click on "RunMe.bat" to start mining. If you want, you can create
    additional workers with usernames and passwords of your choice here

4. Create a Einsteinium address to receive payments.

  • Downloading the client & block chain: Download the Einsteinium client from
    here.

    Generate a new address and input it on your account page to receive
    payments.

5. Advanced CGMiner settings / FAQ

  • Scrypt readme
  • Don't set intensity too high, I=11 is standard and safest. Higher intensity
    takes more GPU RAM. Check for hardware errors in CGMiner (HW). HW=0 is
    good, otherwise lower intensity.
  • Set shaders according to the readme (or look at your graphic cards
    specifications). CGMiner uses this value at first run to calculate
    thread-concurrency. Easiest way to get this optimized is to use same
    settings as others have used here: here.
  • There's also an interesting project which gives you a GUI for CGMiner.
    Windows only it seems.
  • Here's a great guide how to get up and running with Xubuntu.

5. Advanced CGMiner settings / FAQ

  • Scrypt readme
  • Don't set intensity too high, I=11 is standard and safest. Higher intensity
    takes more GPU RAM. Check for hardware errors in CGMiner (HW). HW=0 is
    good, otherwise lower intensity.
  • Set shaders according to the readme (or look at your graphic cards
    specifications). CGMiner uses this value at first run to calculate
    thread-concurrency. Easiest way to get this optimized is to use same
    settings as others have used here: here.
  • There's also an interesting project which gives you a GUI for CGMiner.
    Windows only it seems.
  • Here's a great guide how to get up and running with Xubuntu.

    your own account. Eg, "-u Steve.StevesWorker -p StevesWorkerPassword" then
    go to "File > Save as" and save the file as "RunMe.bat" in the same folder
    containing your miners application files. You are now ready to mine, double
    click on "RunMe.bat" to start mining. If you want, you can create
    additional workers with usernames and passwords of your choice here

5. Advanced CGMiner settings / FAQ

  • Scrypt readme
  • Don't set intensity too high, I=11 is standard and safest. Higher intensity
    takes more GPU RAM. Check for hardware errors in CGMiner (HW). HW=0 is
    good, otherwise lower intensity.
  • Set shaders according to the readme (or look at your graphic cards
    specifications). CGMiner uses this value at first run to calculate
    thread-concurrency. Easiest way to get this optimized is to use same
    settings as others have used here: here.
  • There's also an interesting project which gives you a GUI for CGMiner.
    Windows only it seems.
  • Here's a great guide how to get up and running with Xubuntu.

    If you want to mine on a Windows Operating System, then you'll need to
    create a batch file to start your miner.

    Simply open notepad and then copy and paste the following:

  • SGMiner

    minerd -a m7mhash -o stratum+tcp://xmg.suprnova.cc:7128 -u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

    your own account. Eg, "-u Steve.StevesWorker -p StevesWorkerPassword" then
    go to "File > Save as" and save the file as "RunMe.bat" in the same folder
